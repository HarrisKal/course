# How to solve problems:  
  
## Understand the Problem  
  
Can I *restate* it in my own words?  
What are the *inputs* that go into the problem?  
What are the *outputs* that should come from the solution?  
Can the outputs be *determined* by the inputs?  
Do I have enough *information* to solve the problem?  
How should I *label* the important pieces of data that are a part of the solution?  
  
## Explore Concrete Examples  
  
Start with inputs being *simple* examples and figure out what the output should be.  
Progress to more *complex* examples.  
Explore examples with *empty* or *invalid* inputs and the outputs.  
  
## Break it down  
  
Identify the main *parts* of the problem.  
Write *pseudo code* in comments.  
  
## Solve / Simplify  
  
Solve the problem if you can.  
If not, solve a *simpler problem* or refer to the solution to one.  
Try to *ignore the difficult part* in order to focus on everything else  
Write a *simplified solution* and then incorporate the difficulty back in.  
  
## Look Back and Refactor  
  
Can you derive the result *differently*?  
Can you *understand* the code at a glance?  
Can you *improve the preformance* of your solution?  
How have *others* solved this problem?  
Can you use the method for some *other problem*?  
  
```javascript  
function groupEqualNumbers(arr) {  
   let result = [];  
   for (let n of arr) {  
      // If it already exists in the result, push it to the subarray  
      if (result.some(subarr => subarr.includes(n))) {  
         result.find(subarr => subarr[0] == n).push(n);  
      }  
      // If not, create a new array and add n to it.  
      else {  
         result.push([n]);  
      }  
   }  
   return result;  
}
