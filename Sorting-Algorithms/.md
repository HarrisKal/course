# Sorting

Sorting is used to *arrange* the elements of an array in a specific order.
There are different ways to sort an array called sorting *algorithms*.
Each algorithm has its own benefits and drawbacks.

## Elementary Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort relies on two nested loops. 
The outer one starts at end of arr and reaches start. 
The inner one starts at 0 and ends at outer - 1.
Compare two els of the arr and swap them accordingly.
The larger values bubble their way to the top.
Check if we swapped anything during an iteration. 
If we did, continue looping. If not, stop the loop because we are done.
max Tc = O(n^2), min Tc = O(n), Sc = O(1)

### Selection Sort

On selection sort, iterate through the array and find the smallest item.
Then, move this element to the beginning of the array.
Continue finding the smallest element, excluding the first one.
After finding it, place it next to the other confirmed element.
This continues until the array is sorted. It is the least efficient way of sorting
Tc = O(n^2), Sc = O(1) 

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort relies on taking each el of an arr and finding out where it goes 
in the sorted portion. Loop through the arr. As long as each el is larger than 
the previous element, move it closer to the start of the array.
It is the most efficient out of the elementary sorting algorithms and is often used
when the array is almost sorted or if new data is constantly coming in.
max Tc = O(n^2), min Tc = O(n), Sc = O(1)

## Intermidiate sorting algorithms

### Merge Sort

Merge sort relies on the fact that an array of 1 element is already sorted.
With merge sort, we split the array into arrays of 1 or 0 els using recursion, and
by comparing the elements of each subarray, we merge them together.
Tc = O(n log n), Sc = O(n)

### Quick Sort

Expliots the fact that arrays are sorted when their length is 1.
Quick sort works by selecting a pivot point. All els smaller than the pivot go 
to its left side, all els greater than the pivot go to its right side. 
Then, it recursively applies itself to both sides.
Tc = O(n log n), Sc = O(n)

### Radix Sort

Radix Sort is special, as it only works in integer arrays.
It never makes comparisons between the elements of the array.
Exploits the fact that the information about the size of the
number is encoded in the number of digits.
First, look at the first digit and group the numbers based on it.
Then, put them in order of ascending last digit. In the order that they are in, group them by the second digit, and repeat the process, until hitting the last digit of the greatest number.
